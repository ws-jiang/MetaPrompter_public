{"raw": "ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said. They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products. But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be their gain. The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost. Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes. \"We wouldn't be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>. \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James Capel and Co>. In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried. \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named. Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S. The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest. \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>. A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan. Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S. In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports. \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry. \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said. The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports. The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday. \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter,\" Button said. He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that country. Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy. The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year. They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an effort to end the dispute.

{"raw": "JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports. Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said \"I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade.\" Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control Japanese traders. \"The United States has excessive expectations.,\" he said.

{"raw": "DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT Financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy. The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs. Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year. \"In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit,\" said Stanley Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst. \"At best, it will have a small positive effect,\" Collander said in an interview. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar. The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught with danger. Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit. In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels. As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit. The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending. \"If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else you do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States. Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession. Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none. But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets. \"There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer is, it's not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters. The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's most vexing and persistent problems. The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year's figure will be any lower, though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end. In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget. On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs. \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you're going to get\" out of Congress at the present time, said Touche Ross's Collander. \"To do something more than that would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\" Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels. \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street.\" The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year. The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.  ", "label": 28}

The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February, double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally. \"Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend,\" said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto. Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year. \"We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is indicative of that,\" commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd. Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion dls in the month. \"Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 5.9 pct in February,\" the agency said in its monthly report. Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85 billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.

The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early afternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy. They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country. Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency. \"We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export performance is income growth in the U.S.,\" said Midland's Donegan. But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's trade upturn.

The report said the assessment was based on travel in the two countries from March 30 to April 4. It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the prolonged winter temperatures this spring. However, in general plant development was at least three weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied greatly by regions, the report said. Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about 65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others varied considerably, the report said. Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and uneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.  ", "label": 12}
{"raw": "U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER Prospects appear slim for a summer meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains agreement, Agriculture Department officials said. The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up to last February. However, any delay this year should not endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends through September, 1988, USDA officials said. \"It will be difficult to pull together the people for the meeting during July,\" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said. Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the next talks could still be a \"couple more months,\" he said.  There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made. \"I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer or before the next agreement year begins,\" a USDA source said. Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next year's crops, he said, \"There are too many variables now. It would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.\" Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping logistics and production outlooks.  ", "label": 12}
{"raw": "SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT Recent announcements from Moscow of next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes, Agriculture Department analysts said. USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes. Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday, putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be \"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.\" \"This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne (grain) crop,\" the analyst said.  In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235 mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure published in a Soviet economic journal this month. USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said. Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said. While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest. A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.  ", "label": 12}

{"raw": "GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays, administration and industry sources said. Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters. GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March. The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on the program's impact on the USDA loan program. If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less. GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said. But a negative report on certificates \"will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program,\" an agricultural consultant said. The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program, while USDA remains firmly committed to it.  ", "label": 12}
{"raw": "SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. \"From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year),\" Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. \"Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us,\" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. \"Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness,\" Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said. \"The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now,\" a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said. \"A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half,\" Martell said.

A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in 10 years. \"The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes of grain is not simple,\" Izvestia said.

The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988. Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975. Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was. \"We have had one agreement.

The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf, which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags -- effectively making them American ships. Since the administration made known its reflagging plans, congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted, and some charged the policy could lead the United States into the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq. The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf. The resolution was expected to pass without controversy today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution. Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the bill implied consent to Reagan's policies.  ", "label": 25}
{"raw": "U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not place any restrictions on its actions. The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.

The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and Republican leadership as well as by the administration -- required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf. It did not, however, place any restrictions on the administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy. The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature. Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a first step toward a greater congressional involvement in formulating policy. But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the administration to address tough policy questions in the report.  ", "label": 25}

{"raw": "SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said. Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October. But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position. \"We'll be back in position in first place within three years,\" Komatsu said in an interview. He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak. But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off. Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch. The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves. \"They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it's largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co. Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other. \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst. But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time. \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said. Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home. Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking. But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities. \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.\" Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said. He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo. The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct. But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary. \"We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years,\" he said. Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added. The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo. \"It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said Kleinwort's Smithson. \"After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong.\"  ", "label": 0}

The Mainichi Shimbun quoted Nippon Steel as saying that China's State Planning Commission and some Chinese firms have asked Japanese makers to sell them steel works and rolling mills to expand steelmaking cheaply. It named no sources. A Nippon Steel spokesman told Reuters that China has made no such official request, and the company was not considering such sales at the moment. But Mainichi quoted Nippon Steel officials as saying if prices are reasonable, they would export their used mills to China. The paper said China's crude steel output totalled 52 mln tonnes in calendar 1986 and that it plans to increase to 80 mln by 1996. Japan's steel industry rationalisation plan is aimed at cutting production capacity sharply over the next few years.  ", "label": 0}
{"raw": "SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN> to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources in the Philippine food and brewery company said. A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB. Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares. Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's plans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of fiduciary duties.\" The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a government nominee on the company's board. De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders, asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by the company's board. On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends. De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1. In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties. De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board meeting. An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15. \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in a statement. \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added. A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco's court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial.\" Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen. The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares, which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which are available to foreign buyers. SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB. The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June. \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz told Reuters. \"But everything is on hold now.\" The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders' meeting, scheduled for May 14. San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.  ", "label": 0}

{"raw": "PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders. Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. \"We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed,\" he said. Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin requirements. The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. \"When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it,\" Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills. Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring. He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year.  ", "label": 0}

{"raw": "TIN TRADERS' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET European free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October. Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current \"free market\" system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries. There is also a view among European traders that, while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable. Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved. Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4,680 stg in December 1986. This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350 stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year. LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065 tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485 tonnes reached in February 1986. Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987. However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December. The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers. There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year. Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved, and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal. Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members nations of the International Tin Agreement. The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin position. Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter. The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.

{"raw": "ITC CONTESTS USE OF DOCUMENTS AS COURT EVIDENCE The International Tin Council, ITC, intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the presentation of internal Council documents as evidence. The intervention in Shearson Lehman's action against the London Metal Exchange over its \"ring out\" of tin contracts in 1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer stock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said. The ITC's case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next week. Court does not sit tomorrow. In essence the Council is claiming that its status is similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can therefore not be used in an English court of law.

{"raw": "THAI SMELTER FACES TIN CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTAGE Thailand's major tin exporter and producer &lt;Thailand Smelting and Refining Co> (Thaisarco) said it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines. Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to Thaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> unit, to less than 20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne average, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters. He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported tin lapse on June 3. The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct this month from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lower levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985. Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100 tonnes per day. As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some 3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the year ending February 1988. Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to allocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said. The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however, because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral Resources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late this month, Yoot said. The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin during January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.  ", "label": 27}

{"raw": "ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS Mine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period.  ", "label": 27}

The ATPC hopes to cut the 70,000-tonne world surplus by 20,000 tonnes and boost prices. All ATPC members except Zaire and Australia recently agreed to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan. Australia said its quota of 7,000 tonnes was roughly equal to its expected output this year. The ATPC consists of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Bolivia, Australia, Nigeria and Zaire. China and Bolivia, important producers of tin, are not members.  ", "label": 27}

The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers' interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to 90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes overhang. It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay at 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively unless there is a large and abrupt price jump. The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help push up the price of tin, the bulletin said. A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin cheaper in sterling terms, it added. \"Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo,\" the bulletin said.

{"raw": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BOLIVIA Bolivia, once Latin America's most delinquent debtor, is preparing for a second International Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending. A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement. He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility. The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed, Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months. Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980, opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt. Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the negotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be finalised, had been extremely successful. Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988. Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said. Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs. Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986. Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited inflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate. Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market- related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations. Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months, according to the Central Bank, and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years. The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest has not been paid since March, 1984. Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the country's creditor banks will take up the offer. One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country. But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years. The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme. Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow. Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years. The government realises that in order to remain viable, Bolivia will need to develop new exports. The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of Bolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets, and gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant supply in the region.

In the first nine months of this year, industrial output rose by 3.6 pct. Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent to gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pct against a planned 4.1 pct this year. He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in 1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year. The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986 and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the harvest this year. Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineering industry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets. \"Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,\" said Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan. Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods, increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of this year against the same period of 1986. This is well below the 7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988. Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recent meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to a large extent on conserving resources better. \"Large-scale measures are planned to save resources,\" he said. Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Soviet defence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, the same as announced last year.

Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of 1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period. Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986 period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2 pct. Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given. One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last year's calculations of industrial output included all goods, irrespective of quality. Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below standard. Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were rejected in the nine-month period. The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000 people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector, Pravda said, without giving comparative figures. The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the economy has been an important part of the modernisation campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the setting up of small shops on a private basis. Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986. But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in the West, which measures worker output over a given period. Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5 mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period last year.

A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded capital.

That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12 cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments, to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.

{"raw": "SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM A sugar mill which was this nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday, saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic. The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO) will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to 40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital, the company said. \"Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane after April 10,\" the mill warned planters earlier this week. Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work. At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound (45-kg) bags of sugar. \"We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar. We have no money left to continue operations,\" Rigaud said. He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers. Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar. He said the government then began importing refined sugar at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and the provisional military-civilian government that replaced Duvalier last year continued the policy. \"But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,\" Rigaud said. HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above the usual minimum wage of three dlrs. It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people. Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. \"We're dead, and it's the government that's causing us to die,\" declared Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.  ", "label": 26}

{"raw": "CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS China will not increase sugar imports substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints and large stocks, despite falling production and rising domestic demand, traders and the official press said. \"Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to be extremely serious,\" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986 plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated. The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year. The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500 tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure. The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the area under sugar was dropping. \"Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,\" the newspaper said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane is a major problem.\" A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian, south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in area planted. He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar. The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667 hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only 70 from one mu of sugarbeet. The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to 4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980. Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills. The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the official press has said. Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985. The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier. A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986 when the central government resumed control of imports. \"As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,\" the diplomat said. The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly as coal had priority. \"How quickly they can move the sugar is one factor determining import levels,\" he said. Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba, China's major supplier through barter trade, he said. \"China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about 152/153 dlrs a tonne,\" he added. \"China is not a desperate buyer now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into the open market.\" A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding imports was price. \"While the foreign trade situation has improved this year, foreign exchange restraints persist,\" he said. The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five pct a year but \"a communist government is in a much better position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the foreign exchange situation demands it.\"  ", "label": 26}

Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record 501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December) crop year. The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced 486,790 tonnes. For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup. Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by June 23. Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June 23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said. The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds received to-date. The balance will be paid in October. Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of 23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said. However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of 14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane harvested by November 30, he said. Ganilau said, \"This will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing.\" Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off. The FDB rejected this request. Ganilau said, however, \"The bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on a case-by-case basis.\" In response to a further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas. He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the commencement of harvest. Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible, he added.  ", "label": 26}

{"raw": "FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY Finance ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth. In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a \"good meeting\" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome. Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly. The communique said, \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.\" It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed \"extraordinary and urgent measures\" including an \"unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.\" The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels. In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows. Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports. The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate. It said the officials \"reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\"  ", "label": 18}
{"raw": "G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve. At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said. He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable. Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental. \"As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea,\" he said. The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said. It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said. Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable. He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement. Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks. The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.

In remarks before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned. \"But I do suggest,\" he said, \"that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts.\" He said that indicators can serve \"as a kind of compass\" but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies. Baker, however, said the IMF \"needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today.\" The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public. \"In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF recommendations, and greater use of special consultation procedures,\" he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device \"for moving beyond rhetoric to action.\" He said they provide \"more structure to the system, and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination.\" He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators. \"This should be matter of priority for the executive board,\" he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that \"can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options.\" He said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives. \"If we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course, then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables,\" he said.

Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates. Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates, however. Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation. But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate. It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said. Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell. \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity.\" Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said central banks would continue to intervene \"as and when necessary.\" He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday. Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament. \"If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is still a risk,\" he said. Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar, he said, \"If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States.\" Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit. \"We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year,\" Lawson said. The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention. Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord, he said, \"I don't think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.\" Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson said, \"the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant.\" He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that \"current levels\" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been \"carefully worded.\" \"We know what we mean, and we all mean the same thing,\" he said. Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement. Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand. They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year.

They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other. The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies. Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the U.S. And world economies, they said.

Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules. The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise. \"The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,\" commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer. Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest. The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards. The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output. The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.  ", "label": 3}

Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes. Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the 1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market. \"Even before he started operations, traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level, and yet he appears reluctant to do so,\" one manufacturer said. \"We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply step back,\" he added. \"The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next,\" one processor said. \"As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is about to alter his methods,\" he added.

{"raw": "COCOA ORIGINS DISMAYED BY BUFFER STOCK ACTION Traders recently returned from West Africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases. One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows. So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted, only on an intermittent basis. They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him. The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers. London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price). However, little progress has been made in that direction, and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously. The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said. Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers, they observed. A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities. In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes. Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes. Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271.

{"raw": "ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS Asian cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior. \"Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product,\" said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate general of plantations. \"We're happy about our long-term future.\" Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes. They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices. London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids. Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe. A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans. \"When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to talk down prices,\" the spokesman said. He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces. PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain. The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as \"trade politics\" and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports. Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987. This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest cocoa growing area. Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes this year as young trees mature. Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries. According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic. Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques. One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates.  ", "label": 3}
{"raw": "BAHIA COCOA REVIEW Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB.

Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec.

{"raw": "PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago. Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the May/September crop. The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected. Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on. This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot. A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said. Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage, estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0 mln bag mark if the disease hits. Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said. However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September. The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop, which officially starts on October 1. \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December,\" one said. If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln bags, the lowest since 1974. Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag record, while last year's output, which also suffered some drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags. Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans. The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30. Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared. Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals. With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared, the sources said. This would compare with the previous record set last year of 6.03 mln. However, there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be officially registered.

The board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain, the sources added. Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said. The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays, it added. Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100 billion. The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment. The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.

{"raw": "RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA European coffee traders and roasters may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week, traders and officials told Reuters. Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation. \"The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, \" one said. However, the European coffee trade federation meeting, which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week, has revealed gaps in the European position on re-introducing quotas. Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing countries. The roasters said the positions were generally fairly close, and problems with some Government officials. Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence. Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour. \"Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common European Community (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,\" one trader said. \"We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,\" one official said. \"We have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned,\" he added. Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against. \"Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re-introduction, \" he said. \"The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors,\" one trader said. \"However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota meeting in September,\" the official said.

{"raw": "EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said. Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting. The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement, van Horick said. If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement, van Horick said. Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil. Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction. \"Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal leaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said. \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone.\" Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said. Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota. \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula, \" van Horick said. At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude. \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might just get an agreement,\" van Horick added.  ", "label": 4}

Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict. He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical discussions with Colombian officials. While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe, Cardenas left a \"positive letter,\" Rosenbaum said. The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the Colombian plan. Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by European coffee roasters and traders. Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement. The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless \"objective criteria\" which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits.  ", "label": 4}

{"raw": "U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED A voluntary compliance system for monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and trade sources. \"Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other,\" one analyst said. On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill. Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification, it will still be allowed entry. While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls, trade sources said. \"Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,\" a U.S. Customs spokesman said. \"Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to destination),\" he said. Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system. \"It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement,\" said one major U.S. roaster. \"Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did not act as a gentleman,\" said another analyst adding, \"without the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the producers' hands.\" Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market, in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount. Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely labelled. According to customs officials, several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations, forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans. \"If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions,\" said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko. Still, others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the U.S. in the near term. \"It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a threat,\" one trader said.

He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction. Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be used for calculating the export performace portion. The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.

Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates. Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977. \"The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable,\" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990. \"However, the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction,\" Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices. \"An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if we imposed it alone,\" Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy.

The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984. The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case. \"Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they could,\" Elton said.

Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co. \"There is some reluctance to trade with Texaco but no great change,\" said another trader, adding that traders are tending toward prudence in their dealings with the company. Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco on an open line basis, he said. Another trader, however, described today's activity as business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in bankruptcy. Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins for Texaco's trades. New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for companies that are in financial trouble.

{"raw": "ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION Ecuador will resume limited crude output next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said. CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to neighbouring Colombia. Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific port of Balao. It will take at least until the end of July to repair the pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor. To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying 55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco. The original target date to resume limited crude output was May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman said.

The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5 by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline, Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said. The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling will begin in September. \"The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only for this emergency period but for the next five years, with possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) will be pumped along it,\" Perry said. Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents per barrel during the first year. The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the Pacific port of Tumaco. Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was \"insignificant compared with what we are going to earn.\" OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before the quake.

Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter. \"Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago,\" he said. He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels. The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output. \"I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions,\" Lajous said. A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is always there as a possibility, he said. \"I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained,\" he said. Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control. He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output, were \"very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer.\"  ", "label": 8}

{"raw": "ANALYSTS PEG U.S. COTTON SEEDINGS 10.6 MLN ACRES U.S. cotton farmers are likely to plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing up for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting intentions report next Tuesday. The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse of what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which begins August 1. Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to 10.9 mln acres. On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres. Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres had been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986 planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln. Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in 1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts said those factors make cotton a profitable crop. \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton. Soybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton market specialists. Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to increased acreage, analysts said. They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government will not pick up the tab for storage. Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from participating in the program, which could result in more cotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of 25 pct of a farmer's base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have. Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the program. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its annual meeting in late January. But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have decided they should be in the program for security reasons. There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the government's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the program is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer. Some cotton specialists said their expectations for increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting intentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is based on information they gathered before their cotton program was announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said traders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output when the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9. Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don't think planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment rate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreage harvested. Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\" at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing states. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said.  ", "label": 6}

{"raw": "ANTIBIOTICS IN FEED AID DEADLY BACTERIA: STUDY A study of salmonella poisoning has uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that can infect humans and resist medicines. Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle. Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs. Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect humans. But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans. The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to 298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized for their illness. They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, \"the majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating hamburger that was at least partially cooked.\" The researchers said the results show that \"food animals are a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections in humans, and that these infections are associated with (antibiotic) use on farms.\"  ", "label": 17}

A text was released in Washington. He said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished. \"Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest levels,\" Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid-January. \"I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well,\" he added. Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation. \"The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future,\" he said. Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would \"generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector\" and might not gain more market share for U.S. producers. \"A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern,\" Heller warned. He said \"we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy.\" Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes. \"The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets,\" Heller said. He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada. A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with Canada \"would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American producers to compete more effectively in that country,\" Heller said.

{"raw": "FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY U.S. banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit, economists said. \"It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening,\" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Corp. Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct. Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously. Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the Fed had anticipated. However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week. First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs, partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes. As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed. Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late. Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so. \"It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,\" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day, equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct. After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data, economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.

In an interview with Reuters, chairman G.

Last year, copper demand was second highest on record behind 1984, he said. Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.  During the interview, executive vice president Douglas Yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before the copper price rose \"because there aren't that many new projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession, will continue to grow modestly.\" Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound to more than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a pound rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for Phelps Dodge, the company said. \"Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction and other areas,\" Yearley said.  New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mine owned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's &lt;BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge's own expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by production shortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said. Durham said production costs at the New Mexico-located Chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production at the company's other mines by the fourth quarter.

{"raw": "ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT Zambia's copper mining industry is hoping to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a year in the next few years despite low world prices, deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry officials said. But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said. Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes. \"We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due to greater availability of spares and equipment,\" a ZCCM official said. ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand. Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes higher than the previous year and the best production achieved to date. Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper industry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the country's foreign exchange earnings. Production has also been seriously affected in recent years by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes. A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984 by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African Development Bank and the World Bank. The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable. ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as part of the plan. More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under the five-year restructuring plan. Company officials said although reserves were being depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the end of the century, though at lower levels of production. Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being levied, a net loss is likely to be registered. ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before. Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in 1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over two to the dollar. But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund, and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic strategy based on national resources. ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans. \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare under the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters. Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export profits. \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said. High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian industry. Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69 cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States and under 40 cents in Chile. The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had stopped sBending copper south through South Africa. Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while 5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira. Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and fuel.  ", "label": 5}

Suhud said. The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company, capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen in government loans to the company for an equity stake. The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24 billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen. Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between 1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in dollars. Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.

The government and private interests will equally share the additional investment, he said. They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in Brazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested. The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the official said. Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the two projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the current seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be reached, industry sources said. Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billion yen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32 billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia's investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct. The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an additional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment now totals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51 pct, the official said.

The quality of buffer stock rubber sold since he entered the market in September would be discussed at an INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said. Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in buying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible poor quality. Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the \"may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO's five-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October 16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock was uppermost in consumers' minds. \"We have received good interest for the rubber. I understand the Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubber before they carry on buying,\" he said. Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 different locations in producing and consuming nations, adding all warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage. Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the past week to 10 days and this could reflect a \"wait and see attitude\" by buyers, he said. \"Consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts until they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive, they are likely to buy more.\" Hofmeister said he could reduce the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest but INRO did not want to depress prices artificially. Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimates that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpur and New York since September.

About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus \"corenes pora\" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken. \"The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease,\" an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December. \"If there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,\" a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions. \"Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had,\" one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. \"If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further shortages,\" one official said. \"But this again could benefit prices,\" a buyer said.

The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the disease and added that most estates affected belong to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.

Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725 clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed after use of such clones were discontinued. Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which also affects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experience has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added. \"The disease is extremely difficult to control.

PTT, according to Statoil, is currently negotiating with Texas Pacific to buy back the Dallas-based oil company's holdings in the field. \"PTT must first sort out its problems with Texas Pacific. When this is done, we have said we are interested in taking over a 30 pct share in the field,\" Statoil spokesman Willy Olsen told Reuters. Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisal of the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost of some 700 mln crowns. Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lower reserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown little interest in its development. Statoil refused to disclose its upgraded reserve estimate for the field. The field's reserves could be sold domestically through Thailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to electricity, the sources said.

{"raw": "COLUMBIA GAS &lt;CG> SEEKS CONTRACT COST RECOVERY Columbia Gas Transmission corp said it made an abbreviated, streamlined filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover a portion if its costs of renegotiating high-cost gas purchase contracts. Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing. Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one. The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period, beginning April 1, 1987. Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln. The company said it orginially sought to include these costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were not related to take-or-pay buyout costs. It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April 10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing under the Natural Gas Act. As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas, Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April 1985.

Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987, analysts said. Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies. In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said. Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities. Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers. Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a Brooklyn Union official said. Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through to rate payers. While net effect on the company will not be known for several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings, end-users, especially residential and commercial customers, will end up paying more for gas, he said. Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, said. If the situation persists into winter heating season, high cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said. Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>, Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering firm, said. \"But these companies are not unwitting victims of the take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,\" he said. Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said. Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to alternative fuels, he said. In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said. Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory on the inventory charge, he said. \"Cool heads will prevail,\" DLJ's Launer said, \" but it may take a while.\"  ", "label": 20}

In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport company, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines also transport its own gas to customers. Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERC guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for gas it has bought but could not sell. The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term contracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access. Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to open-access because of the take-or-pay issue.

Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year. \"Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989,\" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said. Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.

Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987. A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices, Shearson's Tulis said. In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added. Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree, saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.

{"raw": "SOUTH KOREA TO CHANGE POLICIES TO AVERT TRADE WAR South Korea has decided on major changes in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a trade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said. Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which means abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings. Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation and rationalising exports. He said Seoul would try to limit its current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few years, although trade volume would continue to grow. \"This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP (gross national product) from the current five pct level to three pct by 1991,\" he added. Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreign debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5 billion dlrs at end-1986. \"But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,\" he said. The policy change was announced two days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae. South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985. Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing in South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose 36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs. The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5 billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said. \"The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at 1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are considerable incentives given to increase imports,\" Koo said. Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency. \"It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean currency continues to rise in value,\" he said. He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the dollar gradually, but added \"We do not believe in rapid one-shot changes in the value of the won.\" The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.

Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the Yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own figures later in the week. Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the current account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled 7.03 billion dlrs. This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the whole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks with the International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapid revaluation of the won against the dollar. The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier. \"Exports in October could be relatively modest due to many public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,\" Yonhap said. The sharp rise in the September surplus came from a resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous month. More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers, electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest between July and September. The South Korean government originally targeted a five billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export boom. If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the United States which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with Seoul last year, government economists said.

{"raw": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP China's foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters. Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low, between eight and 10 pct. China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said. Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on 1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct. Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion. A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market. The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said. A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country's total debt at about 30 pct. The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares. \"Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China, which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread,\" he said. The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s. \"Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the People's Republic of China,\" he said. \"The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls,\" he said. The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16. A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs. \"The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down,\" he said. The banker said such buying has not been going on. \"Things are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development.\" Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985. A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this year's outlook for exports, which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier than a year ago. The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago. The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases. \"We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year,\" he added. Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs. A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct. \"We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a company on its performance, not its bank account,\" he said. He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing.  ", "label": 2}

Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom of Denmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following the country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983. \"This change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor's defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top AAA rating,\" Simonsen said in a statement. \"The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability,\" he added. \"Standard &amp; Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect. \"If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past,\" Simonsen said.

{"raw": "GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS The global economy is expected to weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook, economic analysts said. For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern. The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985. In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said. For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year. The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt. IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade. Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth. Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' economies poses fundamental worries. Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports. The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF. For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success. The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit. Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected. The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect.\" The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion.\" REUTER^M  ", "label": 10}

In their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national product grew 2.4 pct last year. But the report said all the institutes believed that \"more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created.\" The institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. \"From this point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward.\" The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks. However, the institutes criticised the government, not only for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of its financing had been left open. The government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for, though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies. The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government. They also said the government should reduce tax preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value-added tax. The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged. They referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies. The institutes said total subsidies, including tax preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it should be possible \"despite ... Major political difficulties\" to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts. The institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.

Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said, \"None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the beginning of a recession.\" He added, however, that exports remained the weak point of the economy . Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets. Arthur Krumper of Munich's Ifo institute, which with the DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of the economy, said, \"The braking effects (on the economy) produced by external factors will remain considerable for most of the year.\"  ", "label": 10}
{"raw": "CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET The Philippines' first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez said in an interview. The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier. \"I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it (growth) short,\" Fernandez said. NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct. \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said. \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power, showed that the economy was on a different track from last year,\" he said. Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it could drop off in the third quarter. He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986. \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said. He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon. The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988. Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January-June period. He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs. Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years. \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA (official development assistance) accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said. It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said. The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March. Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in October last year, had almost been completed. He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well. \"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said. Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable.\" The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987. NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs. Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved. Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more competitive. \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country's trading partners,\" he said. On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code. The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has been delayed by objections from some business groups. \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and I'm not about to do that,\" Fernandez said. \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free,\" he said. \"We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts.\"  ", "label": 10}
{"raw": "GERMAN GNP FIGURES PUBLICATION DELAYED Figures for first quarter 1987 West German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal Statistics Office said. The official said there had been a delay in gathering information for the data, which are expected to show that the West German economy contracted in the period. A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends. \"There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical matter,\" he added. The West German government is expected to come under pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth. However, government officials have ruled out any further tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of stimulatory fiscal measures already underway. Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period. The government has confirmed that growth was negative in the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to be about two pct. Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate, at three pct, is just above historical lows. West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad, is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over two years. The government has pointed out that depressed exports are the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will compensate for this setback. It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.  ", "label": 10}

GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980 and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according to a government economic survey. The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum and there was an impressive performance in a five point government program for rural uplift, education and poverty alleviation, said the survey. Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct. The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end. Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from 2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion. More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in home remittances, he said. The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to 2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of the boost in exports. He said national investment continued to be small because of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.

{"raw": "GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS The West German government's independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said. A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two pct was achievable. It added the council believed \"an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for.\" Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase. The government regularly uses the term \"changed external economic factors\" when referring to the fall of the dollar, which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but could still fall below the 1986 level. Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar. The stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the West German government ahead of next week's seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy. West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget. The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low. The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast. Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct, compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.  ", "label": 10}

Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will remain stable. The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct. GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and 1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures. GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.

In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption. Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year. In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment, had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong. The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European Community and declining competitiveness. In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather.

Sweden's competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages.

{"raw": "FALL IN CANADIAN BUDGET DEFICIT TO SLOW Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s. \"Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,\" Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons. Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he forecast in the February budget. And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said. Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues. But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system. The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1 billion dlrs in 1991. Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an actual 3.1 pct. Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years.  ", "label": 10}
{"raw": "U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS The economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in U.S. exports should falter, economists say. Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say. \"These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official. The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report. Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending rose a weak 0.1 per cent. \"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing -- are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \" Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics, told Reuters. Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages. To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise, returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption, he says. \"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\" Gramley said. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia. Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative. Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession. Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an inventory overhang still exists. He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar. \"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a recession,\" Mauro said. In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve. \"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said. But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 1.1 pct increase in 1986. The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said. \"The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it continues to persist,\" he said, adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit. A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says a prominent international banker. Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world's largest debtor nation. The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever. \"It is very difficult to be optimistic,\" Gut said.

Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion, but down from 1985's four pct. In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter. \"Essentially it is a flat performance,\" said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.

Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs. \"The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,\" the federal agency said in a statement. The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.

But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end soon. They recommend taking profits. \"It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,\" said Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"Orders will be strong for about two months, and there are signs that some (order rates) are starting to dive already.\" But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp &lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel Industries Inc &lt;IAD>. \"There is still some attractiveness to steels over the short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and rising prices,\" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock, however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to make them more efficient. Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround. Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford noted. \"It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but they've come a long way,\" he said. \"We think the stock will do moderately better than the market,\" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today, could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said. Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987, before special gains from recouped investment tax credits, against losses last year. Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he said. Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buy on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have it,\" he said. The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lot depends on oil prices,\" he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales come from oil and natural gas. Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \"The company's done a lot (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit for,\" she said. She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in 1986. Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has been recommending the stocks since last November. Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the third quarter. But he sees potential trouble beyond then. \"I think (steel) prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,\" he said. Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal dropoff later in the year. \"But there are more positives than negatives,\" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

{"raw": "EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of \"manifest crisis.\" But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a \"voluntary\" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program, particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes.  ", "label": 15}

The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition in its final ruling on the matter. Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the Commerce Department's final ruling of March 9, and activates an anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigator said. The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports have injured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had already ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to 1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said. The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since Commerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said. Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer -- Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty. Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S. supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986, the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of Brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said. Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon tariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said. An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final report on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22. Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and transmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries dating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing duties, Vastagh said.

In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown sharp gains to date. The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S. have caused injury. Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier. The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm. In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm. During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.

Excluding autos, retail sales in February were up 1.5 pct after falling by a revised 0.4 pct in January.

But January sales dropped by 27.7 pct from December levels to 23.52 billion dlrs, more than the 22.4 pct fall originally reported.

Fifty-nine pct of the 325 retailers questioned for the latest Distributive Trades Survey expected sales to be higher in March than they were in March 1986, with only six pct expecting lower sales. The chairman of the Distributive Trades Survey Panel, Nigel Whittaker, said a favourable Budget next week would further help sales during the summer. Figures released earlier this week showed retail sales in January fell 2.2 pct, mainly due to exceptionally cold weather. \"Sales did not recover in February as much as retailers had expected, and they are now looking for better business in March,\" today's survey said. It reported clothing stores were the most optimistic, with 80 pct expecting sales in March to be higher than a year ago.

{"raw": "U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS U.S. retail sales rose sharply in February but many economists said the underlying consumer spending trend remains weak. February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0 pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January's sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously reported 5.8 pct decline. \"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a much more sluggish pace,\" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing. Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4 pct rise for year-over-year sales through February. \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales probably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in February.\" Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline. \"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains in durable goods as well as non-durables,\" noted Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It was a pretty healthy report.\" He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January. \"There are signs of life in the economy,\" McCarthy said. \"But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future.\" A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in February, he said. \"A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding taxes from their paychecks,\" he said. \"When people in this country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination is to go out and spend it,\" he said. Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending. Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws January 1, the Commerce Department noted. Some economists argued that the because the gain in total sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the strength in the February report is less than impressive. \"There is strength in the February data, but that's because they were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said said Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don't see it as a precursor of continued strength.\" Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling 17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained 1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January. Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February, following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales probably accounted for these gains. Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs. \"On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln dlrs in the first quartrer,\" she said. \"We don't look at this as indication that the economy is barrelling along.\" \"The number is not really that problematic for those of us who are constructive on the bond market,\" agreed Elliot Platt of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report. \"The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so confusing,\" he said. \"Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in March,\" he said. \"But now Fed officials will have to wait for the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in April to sort things out.\"  ", "label": 23}

The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pct in February. But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected a rise in excise duties which affected the index in March last year. He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into the monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in April would take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct. Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' input prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors such as a fall in industrial electricity costs. Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures were slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected. Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep input costs down over the next few months, although Tinker added that last year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the year-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return to rises in the index rather than falls.

The average value of the yen against the dollar rose 0.8 pct to 153.50 in February from 154.67 in January and was up 16.8 pct from 184.55 a year earlier, the bank said. The export price index in February fell 0.7 pct from a month earlier reflecting price cuts in export products like cars and precision instruments due to severe foreign competition. The index was down 7.1 pct from a year earlier. The import price index rose 1.1 pct from a month earlier to 57.4 for the sixth successive month-on-month gain mainly due to the continued strength of world crude oil prices. But the index was down 29 pct from a year earlier. The domestic price index fell 0.1 pct to 91.9 in February, its 24th straight monthly drop, mainly reflecting falls in prices of home appliances such as colour televisions due to severe sales competition at home. Lower edible oil prices added to the decline. The index was down 6.7 pct from a year earlier. The domestic index marked its largest year-on-year drop of 7.1 pct in January since the central bank started compiling such statistics in 1960 under its current system. Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March as higher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected, the bank said.  ", "label": 30}

EC farm ministers have been unable to agree the tax, one of the main items proposed by Andriessen for the 1987-88 farm price package.

Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the exports of 26 ACP countries. They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides. They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices. The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could raise up to two billion Ecus a year. EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax, are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on June 15. Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports. \"We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these measures,\" Wilson said. The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved. Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only \"as a very last resort,\" but added that the ACP is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan. Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats. Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.  ", "label": 29}

The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and fourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC. The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and steeply increase the costs of industries such as potato processing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said. \"A move by these industries to countries outside the EC cannot be ruled out,\" he added. De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugely expensive administratively. He also said the proposed tax contravened not only article three of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Lome Convention, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) guidelines, but also the EC's own Treaty. The proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also have consequences for employment and investment, he added.  ", "label": 29}
{"raw": "EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax. Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days \"the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy.\" The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said. Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's \"standstill\" agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement. The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system, he added. Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe said. Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level. He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policy's oils and fats regime. \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said. Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules. It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats. EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements, he said. The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax, Tanghe said. The proposed system would not alter the EC nations' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand, he said. It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current import levels, he said. Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system. Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.  ", "label": 29}

The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm price talks, contained the first formal reference to dropping the measure. Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on June 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They are supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Spain.
